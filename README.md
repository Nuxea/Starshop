<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About this course

If you're ready to get serious about web dev - whether you're building a JSON API or a rich web app - you've come to the right place! Symfony is the famous backbone for the most popular PHP libraries, embraces object-oriented best practices and... it's just fun to use!

I want you to feel dangerous with Symfony and love the process! In this tutorial, we get to learn the fundamentals of Symfony, build real stuff and learn the how and why behind how things work. And... we'll do it by building a space-themed site (because I'm a sci-fi geek):

### What I learned :
* Create a new (and tiny!) Symfony app (it's lean but mean)
* Set up a local web server with the symfony binary
$ Get your editor (PHPStorm) + plugins primed for Symfony
* Dive into Symfony Flex & the "recipes" system
* Add some 3rd party packages and bundles
* Routes, controllers and Responses!
* The mighty bin/console tool
* Head-first into Twig & templating
* Your new favorite debugging tool: the web debug toolbar
* Simple, but crazy-powered CSS & JS setup with AssetMapper!
* Install & Running Tailwind CSS
* Intro into Stimulus & Turbo for JavaScript & an SPA (single page app) feel
* Create a JSON API endpoint
* All-important "service objects": a quick tour of using them and creating your own
* Say hello to MakerBundle
